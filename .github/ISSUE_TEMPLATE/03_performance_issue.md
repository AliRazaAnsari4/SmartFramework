### Description

<!--
* A clear and concise description of the performance issue. What specific operation is slow or unresponsive? When did you first notice the problem?
* Include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. This might be the smallest possible code snippet; a small repo to clone, with steps to run it; or a script.
* Indicate if the performance issue is consistent or sporadic.
-->

### Configuration

<!--
* The version of .NET (including any specific service packs or patches) the code is running on.
* OS version and distribution (if applicable).
* System architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64).
* Details about the machine's hardware, such as CPU, RAM, and disk type (SSD/HDD).
* Any specific library or framework versions the application is using.
-->

### Regression?

<!--
* Was this always a problem, or is it a regression from a previous state? If so, what has changed (e.g., software upgrade, hardware modification)?
* If applicable, information about the version where the performance was adequate.
* Indicate whether you can test on previous .NET versions or different environments to help identify the regression window.
-->

### Data

<!--
* Include any relevant benchmark results or performance profiling data.
* If applicable, include images of graphs, timings, or measurements (preferably as text rather than screenshots for searchability).
* Before and after measurements if a regression is identified.
* Links to any relevant performance analysis tools or datasets.
-->

### Analysis

<!--
* Your preliminary analysis, if available. Where do you suspect the problem lies (e.g., network latency, inefficient database query, high CPU usage)?
* Any specific areas of the codebase or dependencies that you think might be involved.
* Related issues, pull requests, or discussions.
* If you have no insights yet, consider any monitoring tools or techniques that could be used to diagnose the issue.
-->

### Additional Context

<!--
* Any other context or information that you think might be relevant to the issue.
* If you have already tried certain solutions or workarounds, please include them here.
